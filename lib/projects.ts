    longDescription:
      "HopeLens is a full-stack, privacy-conscious mental health risk assessment platform designed to facilitate early detection and awareness of mental health challenges. It combines a user-friendly React.js frontend, a resilient Spring Boot backend, and a FastAPI-based machine learning service to deliver real-time, personalized risk assessments based on user input. The platform features a clean and intuitive interface where users can provide emotional and personal details, which are processed by a trained ML model to assess potential suicide risk levels. \n\nDesigned with empathy and simplicity at its core, HopeLens ensures that no user data is stored or shared, reinforcing a strong commitment to privacy. If a high-risk prediction is returned, the platform instantly displays helpful resources and supportive messages tailored to the userâ€™s risk level. Although HopeLens is currently a prototype for educational purposes and not intended for clinical use, it highlights the potential of AI-driven technology in making mental health tools more accessible, responsive, and human-centered.",
